Puppet's command line tools consist of a single `puppet` binary with many subcommands. The following subcommands are available in this version of Puppet:

Core Tools
-----

These subcommands form the core of Puppet's tool set, and every user should understand what they do.

<% core_apps.each do |app| -%>
- [puppet <%= app %>](<%= app %>.md)
<% end -%>

> Note: The `puppet cert` command is available only in Puppet versions prior to 6.0. For 6.0 and later, use the [`puppetserver cert`command](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6/puppet_server_ca_cli.html).

Secondary subcommands
-----

Many or most users need to use these subcommands at some point, but they aren't needed for daily use the way the core tools are.

<% occasional_apps.each do |app| -%>
- [puppet <%= app %>](<%= app %>.md)
<% end -%>

Niche subcommands
-----

Most users can ignore these subcommands. They're only useful for certain niche workflows, and most of them are interfaces to Puppet's internal subsystems.

<% weird_apps.each do |app| -%>
- [puppet <%= app %>](<%= app %>.md)
<% end -%>
